Test Case: Delay distance between passes is both consistent and accurate

Setup: Ensure that the arduino.json file in the .vscode folder is loading the main.ino file by
        setting: "sketch": "src/main.ino".

Precondition: The system_consistency_of_passes_during_wind test has been run and passed. This test
              cannot yield meaningful results if the aforementioned is not true.

Units Under Test:
  Physical: All - As in, error in any physical configuration could result in failure of test case.

  Software:
    In addition to the below member function / variable validation, validation of the implementation of the
    control logic specific to this functionallity is also ment to be tested.
    - config::pass_offset_steps
    - Mandrel.inc_step_count_at_start_of_pass();


Background: This is a system test intended to check primarily the accuracy, followed by the consistency,
            of the offset length between passes. This functionality is crucial to creating precise wraps
            as it determines the accuracy in which the filament strands can be layed next to one another. 

Test Parameters:
  - config::filament_width should be tested for the values [1/16. 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1]
  - config::wrap_angle should be tested over at least 3 distinct values

Procedure:
  1. Set the config::filament_percent_overlap = 0. 
  2. Set the config::total_layers >= 2 to give an adequate number of passes to compare consistency between.
  3. Attach a marker to the end of the filament application head (likely via rubber bands).
  4. Tape paper around the mandrel which covering the full wind area.
  5. Serial data must be written out when the carriage begin each pass such that the incrementing of steps
      between passes can be validated. This is done by adding the following in main.ino:
      if (Mandrel.get_step_count() == Mandrel.get_step_count_at_start_of_pass())
      {
        Serial.print("Mandrel step count");
        Serial.print(Mandrel.get_step_count());
        Serial.print("\n");
        Carriage.clear_home_dir_flip_flag();
      }
  6. Run main.ino
  7. Manually control the pressure of the marker on the mandrel as to not rip the paper, since
      the mandrel is not perfectly circular.
  7. For a value of filament_width of which offset is noticable by eyesight, maybe 1, set
      config::filament_percent_overlap = 0.5.

Expected Results:a
  - The perpendicular length between angled lines should be filament_width +- 1/32" for all values. This distance is 
    NOT to be confused with the delay distance at the home end (call it d, d = l*cos(wrap_angle), where l is the 
    perpendicular distance measured). The delay distance should be consistent between successive passes to the same
    tolerance. In the serial data, it should be shown that the delay steps is incremented by the correct value (compare
    against manually calculated value), and that the rollover when the delay steps are > 849 is properly handled.

  - In the case where config::filament_percent_overlap is non-zero, the carriage should delay a distance of the 
    filament_width * (1.0 - filament_percent_overlap) to the same tolerance as above.

LAST EXECUTED RESULTS:
  - (July 15, 2019) Offest was correct for all values over wrap angles of 30, 45, and 65 degrees. The tolerance of
    perpendicular length distance between lines was +- 1/32".
