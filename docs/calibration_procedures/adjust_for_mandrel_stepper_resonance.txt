Background:
Due the inherent nature of stepper motors, there exists a natural frequency of rotation
at which the stepper motor will be unable to rotate as intended and its behaviour
becomes undefined. In some cases, loading the motor will mitigate this behaviour, but 
in the case of mandrel stepper motor of the filament winding machine, it is unavoidable.
At some wrap angles it is possible that the mandrel stepper will reach this natural frequency.
A simple indicator of when the mandrel stepper speed is nearing its natural frequncy is that
the stepper motor will vibrate more, and operation of the machine will become audibly louder.
To allow for sinding wrap angles close to or on the natural frequency, the speed of the carriage,
config::carriage_velocity, must be changed, as the mandrel speed is directly dependent on this.

Procedure:
The equation which sets the carriage velocity is currently:
  
  const double carriage_velocity = (80 + (9 * deg_wrap_angle / 10)) / deg_wrap_angle; // in/s

By decreasing the numerator of the equation, a good way of doing this is decreasing the value of
80, say to 60, the carriage velocity will decrease and inturn the mandrel velocity will decrease. 
Thus the resonany frequency will be moved from occuring at the current wrap angle, to a higher 
wrap angle (when the mandrel speed is once again fast enough to near the natural frequency).
Thus, manipulating the numerator to change the speed of the mandrel will be sufficient to allow
winding at the former troublesome wrap angle.
