// /* Note the mandrel should be under load to prevent loud oscilations */
// /* slowest - works all the way through max val of delayMicroseconds */
// /*            slowest is really more like delay(10) */
// /* There should be checks in the code to make sure mandrel / carriage velocity is never faster than certain speed bc bad stuff happens (motor stalls) */
// /* fastest mandrel speed is delayMicroseconds(500); */

// /* Cariage works well around 1 milisecond delay */
// Motors are wired in: A+ = red, A- = blue, B+ = green, B- = black
